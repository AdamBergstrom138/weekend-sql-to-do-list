# To Do App

To Do App is an application that stores your ‘to do’ tasks on a server.  You can mark them complete or delete them.

## Description

Duration: Weekend Project

It was a challenge for me to get the complete button working the way I wanted.  I wanted the user to be able to toggle the complete status and have a visual representation of this on the DOM.  I was able to get this functionality working by conditionally changing the button based on data from the server.
